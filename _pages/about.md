I am a Doctoral Fellow specializing in Machine Learning at [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale](https://siu.edu/) where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the SPEED Lab under the supervision of [Ahmed Imteaj](https://ahmedimteaj.github.io/).

My research is centered on building robust and secure AI systems. I develop methods that enhance the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of AI in real-world environments, with expertise spanning Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Federated Learning. Additionally, I work on scalable, efficient, and resilient AI solutions that address industry-critical challengesâ€”particularly those involving adversarial threats, data privacy, and model robustness.

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at [Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur](https://www.iut-dhaka.edu/) with a CGPA of 3.79 out of 4.00. During my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable industry experience working as a Software Developer Intern at Brain Station 23 and as a Fullstack Software Developer at Sari LLC.

My research has been published in top-tier venues including IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, and IEEE International Conference on Big Data. I am passionate about transforming cutting-edge research into practical tools that drive business innovation and system-level security.

I will be joining AT&T as an Advanced Research Intern in Summer 2025, where I will continue my work on advancing secure and robust AI systems.
